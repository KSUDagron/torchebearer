    <i><p>With whispered words, the magician calls forth dancing ï¬‚ames from the aetherial plane.</p></i>
    <h3><b>Spell Effect</b></h3>
    <p>The magician summons a number of lights that dance and whirl about the head. Each wisp provides light equivalent to a candle and are unaffected by wind and weather. They can even give light when submerged. <br><br>With a thought, the caster may send the lights down corridors or around corners, giving the appearance of a party of adventurers carrying candles. The caster may also command each light to hover in a different place or follow a different person. The magician may choose to end the spell at any time.</p>
