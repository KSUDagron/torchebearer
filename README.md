# torchbearer
 Unofficial community Torchbearer RPG system for Foundry VTT
 
 The "Goal" of this system implementation is to automate as much of Torchbearer's bookkeeping as possible.
 
 ## Current State
 * Drag and drop inventory! Hauling items around has never been easier.
 * All abilities and skills are rollable from the character sheet (seen in the gifs below) and tests passed and failed are automatically logged after each roll. The rolls also automatically apply Beginner's Luck rules if the skill being rolled has a rating of 0!
 * Rolls are automatically resolved and rerolls can be made from the roll output in the chat box.
 * A trait's beneficial uses desciptor automatically updates to match the trait's level.
 * A trait's beneficial uses automatically get ticked off when they're used in a test. Likewise, the sheet automatically logs checks when you use a trait against yourself during a test.
 * Skills can be automatically advanced when the necessary number of test passes/fails have been achieved.
 * Persona and Fate spend on rolls are automatically logged on the character sheet.
 * A grind/turn tracker makes it easy for the GM and players to keep track of light sources and other events. It also presents an at-a-glance view of character conditions and lets players easily trade items between their inventories.

## In Active Development
* Create a dedicated sheet for running conflicts complete with hidden action selection, weapon selection, and roll resolution.
* Add Beliefs/Instincts/Goals to the turn tracker/party sheet.

## Future Plans
* Create a camp sheet so players can see everyone's relevant camping stats in one place.
* Integrate a character builder to populate the character sheet based on user input (like when first creating a character or choosing level up benefits).
